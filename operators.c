    /* Arithmetic Operators

    +	Adds two operands.
    âˆ’	Subtracts second operand from the first.
    *	Multiplies both operands.
    /	Divides numerator by de-numerator.
    %	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.
    ++	Increment operator increases the integer value by one.
    --	Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.

    /* Relational Operators

==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true..
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.

    /* Logical Operators

&&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
!	Called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false.

    /* Assignment Operators

=	Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
+=	Add AND assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand.	C += A is equivalent to C = C + A
-=	Subtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.	C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A
*=	Multiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.	C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A
/=	Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.	C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A
%=	Modulus AND assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.	C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A

bitwise assignment operators

<<=	Left shift AND assignment operator.	C <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2
>>=	Right shift AND assignment operator.	C >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2
&=	Bitwise AND assignment operator.	C &= 2 is same as C = C & 2
^=	Bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator.	C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2
|=	Bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator.	C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2
    */

    /* Misc Operators

sizeof()	Returns the size of a variable.	sizeof(a), returns the BIT size of the variable (int uses 4 bit)
&	        Returns the address of a variable.	&a; returns the actual address of the variable.
*       	Pointer to a variable.	*a;
? :     	Conditional Expression.	If Condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y
